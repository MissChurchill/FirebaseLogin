# FirebaseLogin
Firebase login setup

This app demos my ability to integrate Firebase Authentication into an android app.  Following the Udacity Kotlin Android Developer Training I was able to successfully
configure the Firebase authentication with sign-in options for email and password and Google account sign-in.  Learning how to implement this functionality into my apps
has been helpful as I develop more complex apps with multiple users and social media integrations.
